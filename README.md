or maybe you want to just pretty print a string over the console.

## Simple usage

To just pretty print and highlight a HTML string simply type the following command:

one of the following strings as an argument:

- vscode
- material
- dracula

can use at any point to look up the docs.

# Credits

The core alogrithm is taken from [highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js).
Even though it has been rewritten to specifically support HTML and not all languages.
Furthermore the code of pretty-html-log is written in Typescript and optimized for HTML highlighting in the console.
