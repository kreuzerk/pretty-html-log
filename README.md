# Getting started üöÄ

There are two ways to use pretty-html-log

- Use it in your typescript / javascript code
- Use it via command line or in your npm scripts

The module is available as node module and can
be installed with the following command.

```
npm install pretty-html-log
```

> ‚òùÔ∏è If you use it via command line tool you can always directly execute
> the bin with npx (no npm install needed).

```
npx pretty-html-log '<html><h1 class="test"></h1></html>'
```

# API

- **htmlString** **_(required)_** a raw html string
- **theme** _(optional)_ an optional theme (more bellow)

## Themes üé®

Currently pretty-html-log provides 3 different themes:

- Dracula _(default)_
- Material
- Vscode

# Usage over Javascript / Typescript üë®‚Äçüíª

If you want to use this module inside your code you can simply import the hightlight function from
_pretty-html-log_.

## Simple usage

```
import { highlight } from 'pretty-html-log';
const highlightedHTML = highlight(someHTML);

console.log(highlightedHTML);
```

## Choose your theme

The highlight function also accepts a theme as a second optional argument.
A theme can be imported and then passed to the module.

```
import { highlight } from '../lib/pretty-html-log';
import {THEMES} from '../lib/themes/themes';

const someHTML = '<html><div id="someId" class="test">Test</div></html>';
console.log(highlight(someHTML, THEMES.VSCODE));
```

# Use as Script üìú

Sometimes it makes sense to pretty print an HTML string inside your build process
or maybe you want to just pretty print a string over the console.

## Simple usage

To just pretty print and highlight a HTML string simply type the following command:

```
pretty-html-log "<html><body><h1 class="foo">Text</h1></body></html>"
```

## Choose your theme

The command line tool also allows you to choose your theme. Simply use -t or --theme and pass
one of the following strings as an argument:

- vscode
- material
- dracula

```
pretty-html-log "<html><body><h1 class="foo">Text</h1></body></html>" -t vscode
pretty-html-log "<html><body><h1 class="foo">Text</h1></body></html>" --theme=vscode
```

## Help menu

Of course you don't have to remember those commands - theres a help menu available which you
can use at any point to look up the docs.

Simply type

```
pretty-html-log --help
```

or

```
pretty-html-log -h
```

# Credits

The core alogrithm is taken from [highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js).
Even though it has been rewritten to specifically support HTML and not all languages.
Furthermore the code of pretty-html-log is written in Typescript and optimized for HTML highlighting in the console.
